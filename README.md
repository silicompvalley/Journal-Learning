#Welcome to my Learning Journal
A "growth mindset", unlike a fixed mindset, allows for expansion of pathways towards a goal. It also allows for different options should better ones arise and ways to correct oneself if the path trails off or a mistake is made. A fixed mindset is more rigid and difficult to navigate and improve upon.

3 reminders for me to go through this fruitfully 1: I must never give up. There is always a way 2: It feels hard? It's SUPPOSED to be hard! 3: Not smart? Surprisingly, the man who came up with the IQ test himself understood that intelligence can be increased

As you can see, I am learning to *better* my options in the workforce and make my hobbies **broader**.

Why is coding so great?

#About Me
I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and new to Seattle. Wow, Seattle is so close to me (in a travel/leisure sense) and I've *never* visited! I didn't know just how much of a major tourist destination Seattle is! So many places I tried to check out for housing were booked. The air and atmosphere is fresh and I really like the nice and the bustling downtown area. San Francisco may have a lot of nice destinations, but its downtown is kind of ugly and the streets are so dirty.

Stretch Goals
I'd like to learn to code to get into a field that is very much in demand. Also, I enjoy using computers and think it is about time I learned some of the innerworkings of software. It would be great to be able to create something useful that is totally configurable.
